    status: "Shipped & Operational",
    context: "We were building an AI text summary application with a novel \"map-like stretching\" UI to help readers scan long-form content. However, the engineering and product teams were stuck in a \"Monthly Release Cycle\" due to the complexities of interpreting user feedback. This latency meant we only learned if a feature achieved product-market fit once every 30 days, threatening the startup's runway.",
    goal: "Compress the \"Idea-to-Validation\" loop from 4 weeks to <12 hours to accelerate learning.",
    hypothesis: "If we replace slow, manual user recruitment with a high-velocity feedback loop using modern AI tools (Create.xyz for prototyping + VoicePanel for instant testing), then we can validate feature concepts in a single day with real users, reducing engineering waste on low-value features.",
    problem: [
      "Slow Feedback: Traditional user recruitment and moderated testing took 5-10 days per cycle.",
      "High Opportunity Cost: Engineering spent weeks building features that often failed upon release because we couldn't \"see\" users struggling until it was too late.",
      "Subjective Analysis: Feedback was often interpreted subjectively by different stakeholders (\"I think users will like this\"), leading to roadmap conflicts."

      "6:00 PM (Analysis): We watched the recordings. We didn't just look for \"likes\"; we listened for confusion. Insight: If a user narrating their experience got stuck, we double-clicked there. If they lit up, we knew we hit gold.",

    status: "Shipped & Operational",
    context: "A key e-commerce client was suffering from a 6-month loss streak. The firm prioritized stocking \"cash cow\" products (smaller sizes) based on historical sales volume. Larger sizes were listed on the app but frequently out of stock. Analytics showed low sales volume and low LTV for these larger sizes, leading stakeholders to believe there was no market demand.",
    goal: "Identify the root cause of the revenue bleed and prove that \"low sales\" did not mean \"low demand.\"",
    hypothesis: "(Conceived via Return on Customer metrics) If we capture user intent at the \"Size Selection\" funnel stage, specifically for out-of-stock variations, then we can prove that the low LTV on larger sizes is actually a signal of unmet demand, justifying a shift in inventory strategy.",
    problem: [
      "The \"Cash Cow\" Bias: The inventory algorithm over-indexed on high-volume small sizes, leaving high-margin large sizes perpetually out of stock.",
      "Funnel Blockage: The drop-off wasn't at the landing page; it was at the \"Select Size\" step. Users selected a size, found it unavailable, and couldn't \"Add to Cart.\"",

    ],
    solution: [
      "The MVP (UI Fix): We replaced the \"Out of Stock\" dead-end with an \"Availability Request\" feature. Instead of a grayed-out button, users saw \"Notify Me When Available\".",

    role: "Product Lead, Bluewater Media",
    status: "Shipped & Scaled",
    context: "A major beauty chain with 12 outlets and over 100k customers was reliant on a legacy phone-based booking system. This manual process created a bottleneck for growth, data opacity, and high operational costs for the call center.",
    goal: "Direct the digital transformation from analog (phone) to digital (mobile app) without alienating a non-technical customer base.",
    hypothesis: "If we reduce the friction of booking by moving from synchronous calls to an asynchronous mobile app, and we optimize for \"Time-to-First Booking,\" then we will create a habit-forming loop that drives higher long-term retention than the phone channel.",
    problem: [
      "Scaling Bottleneck: Booking volume was capped by the number of receptionists available.",
      "Data Black Hole: Phone bookings provided no behavioral data; we couldn't distinguish between a one-time visitor and a high-frequency regular.",

      "Data-Driven Migration: I analyzed historical data to handle multi-booking edge cases (customers with >3 bookings/month). We prioritized migrating these \"Power Users\" first across the 12 outlets, as they represented the highest value."

    metrics: [
      "Primary Metric: Onboarding Completion & Retention Rate.",
      "Metric Definition: To ensure accuracy, I defined \"Retention\" based on Unique Active Users (deduplicated by User ID) rather than Total Booking Volume. This prevented the data from being skewed by a small cohort of customers with multiple bookings in the same window.",
      "Result: Reached ~80% retention and onboarding completion rates within 3 months of launch.",
      "Operational Impact: Drastically reduced call center volume, freeing up staff to focus on in-store customer experience."
